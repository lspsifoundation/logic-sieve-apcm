# Grant Overview

This repository accompanies the Logic Sieve: APCM grant application submitted to the Solana Foundation.

The grant focuses on validating and finalizing a privacy-preserving, developer-facing infrastructure primitive for Solana.

Initial benchmarks were executed in Google Colab.  
Further development will include a Rust/WASM implementation and a Solana on-chain verifier.
