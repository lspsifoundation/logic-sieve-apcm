# Grant Overview

This repository accompanies a research grant application focused on the
APCM (Asymmetric Private Constraint Matching) protocol.

The grant scope covers validation and refinement of a privacy-preserving,
developer-facing infrastructure primitive for secure semantic matching.

Initial benchmarks were executed in an isolated research environment.
Further development includes a Rust/WASM reference implementation and
formal verification of protocol constraints.

This repository serves as a public research artifact accompanying the grant.
