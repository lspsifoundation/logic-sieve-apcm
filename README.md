# Logic Sieve — Private Set Intersection

## Mission
**Semantic consensus without data leakage.**

---

## Overview
Logic Sieve is an infrastructure-level research project focused on privacy-preserving semantic matching primitives.

The project explores Approximate Private Constraint Matching (APCM) as a core primitive for achieving semantic consensus without exposing underlying data, building on Private Set Intersection and related cryptographic techniques.  
This work supports privacy-preserving collaboration in public digital infrastructure.

Design priorities are correctness, composability, and long-term architectural integrity, with explicit emphasis on auditability.
